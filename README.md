### Connect4
## Game written with Python (Pygame)

## Information

Welcome to Connect4 written in Python. I am quite new to programming so please accept that the code 
may not be written well or may confuse you at some points. I also know that there are still
some bugs in the code. I'll try to solve them by time. The idea behind the game is to add a 1(for Player1) 
or a 2(for Player2) to a dictionary which represents all fields in the game. After every move the dictionary 
will be scanned to look for four equal numbers in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) 
If you want to give me feedback or write sth. else please write an email to liam.beck@protonmail.com
